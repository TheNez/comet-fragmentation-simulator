<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Context
This is an astrophysics simulation project focused on modeling comet fragmentation. The system simulates:

- **Gravitational Forces**: N-body gravitational interactions
- **Tidal Forces**: Roche limit calculations and tidal disruption
- **Comet Structure**: Internal composition and structural integrity
- **Fragmentation Dynamics**: Breakup patterns and debris evolution
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Trajectory analysis and orbital evolution

## Development Guidelines
- Use scientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib)
- Implement physically accurate models based on real astrophysics equations
- Prioritize computational efficiency for N-body simulations
- Include comprehensive documentation and references to scientific literature
- Use SI units throughout the codebase
- Implement validation against known comet fragmentation events

## Key Libraries
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations
- **SciPy**: Advanced mathematical functions and optimization
- **Astropy**: Astronomical calculations and coordinate systems
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting
- **Plotly**: Interactive 3D visualizations
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and results processing
